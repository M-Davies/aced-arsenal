# aced-arsenal
WIP: Website for creating ace arsenal arrays because the eden editor one sucks

# Planned Features
- Importable mods as well as a default set (tbc but it's likely to be ace, vanilla, rhs, basically all the mods that the [Nutters](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/A3Nut) group currently use in their [standard modset](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1339089992))
- As mods get imported, a filterable view is generated that contains the classnames and icons (tbc) that can be dragged across to the target box where the array will be created.
- As mods get added to the target box, the array is dynamically regenerated. 
- More features to be added overtime
